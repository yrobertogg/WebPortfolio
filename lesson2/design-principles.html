            <p>The Proximity principle of design is exemplified on this page. I note that the company uses the proximity principle to categorize the options they want to present, like products, the latest products, differentiators from the store, accessories, etc. Notably, they put together certain options to make the research easy. They added white space to differentiate elements from one another.</p>

            <p>When I read about this web design principle the first image that come to my mind was the pathway webpage. I like so much this layout and this principle because seriously it is beautiful to the eye. In my opinion this white space apart of making a really good job with the hierarchy focus, it makes you feel that you are in a fresh and clean layout.</p>

            <p> It is not very notable in the screenshot, but if you visit the link, you are going to notice the repetition design principle on the church web page. This principle makes you feel that this page is organized well and that it is easy to navigate through it. They also use this principle to repeat and strengthen their logo to make the brand recognizable.</p>
